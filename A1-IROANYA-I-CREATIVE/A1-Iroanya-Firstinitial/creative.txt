What is my creative feature?

1. Random color : press 1 to start shuffling all the sizes and 2 again to stop the shuffle of the particle sizes

2. Random size: press 2 to start shuffling all the sizes and 2 again to stop the shuffle of the particle sizes

3. Random shape: press 3 to start shuffling all the shapes and 3 again to stop the shuffle of the particle shapes


Where it is present in the code

1. My creative feature is in my Game.h file and I added the function
		void creative() {
		if (randomColor) {
			float r = static_cast <float> (rand()) / static_cast <float> (RAND_MAX);
			float g = static_cast <float> (rand()) / static_cast <float> (RAND_MAX);
			float b = static_cast <float> (rand()) / static_cast <float> (RAND_MAX);
			printf("%f %f %f \n", r, g, b);
			color = Color(r, g, b, color.a);
		}
		
		if (randomSize) {
			size = 1 + (rand() % 200);
		}
		if (randomShape) {
			shape = 0 + (rand() % 4);
		}
	}

I called the function here void update(float deltaTime)

On my GAME.h file, my creative feature code can be found on these lines
	i. line 26-31
	ii. line 54
	iii. line 76-92
